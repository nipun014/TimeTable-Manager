# Customizable Timetable Management System (scaffold)

This is a starter scaffold generated by a bootstrap script. It includes a minimal CP-SAT
model using OR-Tools and a small sample dataset. Use it as a starting point for adding
custom constraints, preferences, UI, and data import/export.

See sample_data.json for expected data format.

For a complete architecture walkthrough and extension guide, read ../SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md.

## Input Formats

- JSON: Upload as-is.
- YAML: Also supported (requires PyYAML, already listed in requirements).
- Pasted text: In the Streamlit sidebar, paste JSON or YAML and it will be parsed and converted to the internal schema automatically.

Normalization rules:
- `subjects`, `teachers`, and `rooms` can be dicts keyed by names or lists of items. Lists of strings use sensible defaults; lists of objects require a `name` (or `id`) field.
- Missing `days` or `periods_per_day` default to 5 and 6.
- Missing `availability` defaults to all-available for all days/periods.
- Missing `class_subjects` defaults each class to all subjects.

Example YAML is provided at `timetable_solver/sample_input.yaml`.
