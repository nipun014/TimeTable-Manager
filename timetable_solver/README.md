# Customizable Timetable Management System (scaffold)

This is a starter scaffold generated by a bootstrap script. It includes a minimal CP-SAT
model using OR-Tools and a small sample dataset. Use it as a starting point for adding
custom constraints, preferences, UI, and data import/export.

See sample_data.json for expected data format.
